# About Me

I am Naresh Kumar, originally from my hometown Mithi, where I completed my 12 years of education. I am a passionate and curious individual who loves exploring new ideas and solving problems. I enjoy learning continuously and challenging myself to grow both personally and professionally.

## My Programming Interests

Programming has been a significant part of my life because it allows me to create, innovate, and bring ideas to life. I am particularly interested in areas such as web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working with languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++, and I am fascinated by how programming can be used to automate tasks, analyze data, and build intelligent systems. Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Data Science from FAST-NUCES Karachi, where I am deepening my knowledge and skills in this exciting field. I am excited to keep improving my skills and contribute to projects that make a positive impact.
